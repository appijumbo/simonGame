/* Engine.js
 * This file provides the game loop functionality (update entities and render),
 * draws the initial game board on the screen, and then calls the update and
 * render methods as defined in app.js.
 *
 
 
 Steps of execution

    1)  The power button is turned 'on'
        game.state('powerOn')   outputSignal.powerOn
        
    2)  The 'start' button is pressed, causing game to be initialised; 
        rndSequence.reset()   game.state('ready') game.strict('off') humanPlayer.scorereset
        
    3)  output screen alerts that the start button has been pressed
        outputSignal.copyme() 
    
    4)  Chooses a button and pushed to the random sequence array.
        rndSequence.genNext
    
    5)  The AI player 'plays' the random sequence of buttons. 
        Each button lights up, for Â½ a second
        Buttons won't function when AI is playing
        aiPlayer.play()  rndSequence.read()
    
    6)  If no response after 5 seconds 
        go back to 5)
    
    7)  The human player copies the AI player sequence
        humanPlayer.handleInput    humanSequence.write
    
    8)  compare human and random sequences:
    
            if humanPlayer.sequence.read =! rndSequence.read  & game.getStrict() = true
            game.state('Game Over') 
            
            else if humanPlayer.sequence.read =! rndSequence.read  & game.getStrict() = true
            game.state('fail')
            go to 5)
            
            
            else if if humanPlayer.sequence.read == rndSequence.read
            humanPlayer.countscore(1)
            
      9) If the game.score = 20 human player wins:
        game.state('you win')
