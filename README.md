# Simon Game

This is a traditional game re-created for 
[FreeCodeCamp](ttps://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-simon-game)


User Story: 
I am presented with a random series of button presses.
Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.


Hint: Here are mp3s you can use for each button:

***

In addition to Free code Camps requirements, the aim was to focus on

  * a reasonable UI/UX
  
  * Use Svg

  * Object orientated design
  
  * Sass
  
  * [bourbon](http://bourbon.io) or similar
  
  * Additional game logic design features (See below)
  
  * Use alternative audio samples


Though the game logic hasn't been built yet, here are some of the parts of the design so far.
